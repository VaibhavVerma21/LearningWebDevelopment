TCP/IP Model Layers -
1. Application Layer -> App, through which user interactes.
2. Transport Layer -> TCP protocal exists here, reliable TCP connection
3. Network/Internet Layer -> Decides how routing of data packets is to be handled
4. Link Layer -> Prepares data from network layer and sends it to physics layer i.e. how the signals will be transferred through something like optic fiber or copper wires(basically the one's and zero's)
5. Physical Layer -> Components through which electic or light signals travel like copper wire, optic fiber

OSI Model Layers -
1. Application Layer -> App, through which user interactes.
2. Presentation Layer -> It helps in encoding, data compression, stuff to polish the data that is being transmitted 
3. Session Layer -> Stores the Session and authentication related information like cookies
4. Transport Layer -> TCP protocal exists here, reliable TCP connection
5. Network/Internet Layer -> Decides how routing of data packets is to be handled
6. Link Layer -> Prepares data from network layer and sends it to physics layer i.e. how the signals will be transferred through something like optic fiber or copper wires(basically the one's and zero's)
7. Physical Layer -> Components through which electic or light signals travel like copper wire, optic fiber
