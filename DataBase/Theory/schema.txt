Schema-
It is blueprint of entire database. 
It contains stuff like table name and its attributes, functions and relationships between them, database structure.


Database instance- 
Any point in time, if the database has been changed, then a new database instance is formed.
At t=0 the database instance is empty. After sometime if new data is added to the database, then it leads to a new database instance.


Database most famous way to arrange the data is three schema architecture.
There are three layers in it as the name suggests-
Internal schema -> It is responsible for storing, retrieving the data in and from physics hardware.
Conceptual schema -> It is responsible for creating of tables function and relationships between those data for storing whole dataset.
External schema -> It is responsible for showing the data that is customized for the user requesting it out from the whole dataset.

This architecture enables the programmer to make changes on each level without effecting the other levels.
