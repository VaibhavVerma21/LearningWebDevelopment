In RDBMS, data is stored in table form.

Keys are combinations of one column or multiple columns of a table to identify each row uniquely.
Example: 
For Employee, keys will be - 
Emp_ID
Emp_Name
Pan_Num
Aadhar_num


Super key -> It is a collection of set of all possible combinations of keys. Like super set in set theory. Not very use in real life.
Candidate key -> Subset of Super key. It is a single key or a group of multiple keys that uniquely identify rows in a table.
Primary key -> It is one of the candidate keys. Example: The ID column could be a primary key. It is unique for each table.
Alternate key -> All candidate keys except the primary key are alternate keys.

Foreign key -> It is used to make relationships between tables. The key which is used to make the relationship is called Foreign Key Column. Example: Departement_ID will be found in both Employee table and Departement table. It also provides data integrity by double checking data in both tables.

Composite key -> It is used when primary key can not be formed by only using a single column, it is called composite primary key. If it is not declared primary key, it is called as composite key.

Artificial key -> When no primary key is possible, or composite primary key is too long, then we add a new column(Example: ID) which will be unique and can be used as primary key.
